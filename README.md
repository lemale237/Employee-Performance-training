# INX-Employee-Performance

## Description
This project aims to discover the factors that affect employee performance, to train a model to accurately predict the employee's performance rating, to analyze the data to provide recommendations for improving performance, and to learn from the analysis.

## Project Structure
- `data`: Folder containing the raw data.
- `data_eda`: Folder containing the data after exploratory analysis.
- `data_exploratory_analysis[2].ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis.
- `data_processing[1].ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing.
- `emp_rating_model`: Folder containing the trained model to predict the employee's performance rating.
- `inx_emp.xls`: Excel file containing the raw data.
- `predict_model[4].ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for model prediction.
- `train_model[3].ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for model training.
- `visualization [5].ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data visualization.
- `x_test`: Folder containing the test data for the model.
- `y_test`: Folder containing the test results for the model.

## How to Use This Project
1. Start with the exploratory data analysis in `data_exploratory_analysis[2].ipynb`.
